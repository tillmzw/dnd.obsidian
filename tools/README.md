# Import 5E data into Obsidian

Running `./convert.sh` will run `ttrpg-convert` on the `5etools-mirro` repository (both submodules) following the configuration file.

The configuration file includes a few sources that will be included in the generation, incl. some homebrew content.

The generated data will be placed into `../vault/Mechanics/Generated` and should be automatically indexed by Obsidian.

This setup is based on instructions from the [ObsidianTTRPGProject](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGVault/).
